# chrome-dino-game
A Java-based 2D runner game inspired by the Chrome Dinosaur Game, built as part of an academic project. The game features obstacles, scoring, power-ups like shields, coin collection, day-night transitions, and more â€” all rendered using simple Java graphics and compiled into a runnable `.jar` file.
